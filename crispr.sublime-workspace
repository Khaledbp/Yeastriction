			"\\subsection{Strains and maintenance}\nThe \\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains used in this study (Table 1) share the CEN.PK genetic background (Entian and Kotter, 2007; Nijkamp et al., 2012). Stock cultures were grown aerobically in synthetic medium (Verduyn et al., 1992). When required, auxotrophic requirements were complemented with synthetic yeast drop-out medium supplements (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or by growth in YP medium (demineralized water, 10 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} Bacto yeast extract, 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} Bacto peptone). Carbon sources were either 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose, 2\\% (v/v) ethanol and/or 11.3 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} sodium acetate trihydrate. Stock cultures of \\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains IMZ383 and IMZ384 were grown anaerobically and supplemented with Tween-80 (420 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) and ergosterol (10 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) added to the medium. Frozen stocks of \\emph{S. cerevisiae} and E. coli were prepared by the addition of glycerol (­30\\% v/v) to the growing shake-flask cultures and aseptically storing 1 mL aliquots at -80 °C.\n\n\\subsection{Plasmid construction}\nCoding sequences of Staphylococcus aureus adhE (NP\\_370672.1), Escherichia coli eutE (YP\\_001459232.1) and Listeria innocua lin1129 (NP\\_470466) were codon-optimized for \\emph{S. cerevisiae} with the JCat algorithm (Grote et al., 2005). Custom-synthesized coding sequences cloned in the pMA vector (Table 2) were provided by GeneArt GmbH (Regensburg, Germany). Gateway Cloning technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, A) was used to insert these coding sequences in the intermediate vector pDONR221 (BP reaction) and subsequently into pAG426-pGPD (Alberti et al., 2007) (LR reaction). The resulting plasmids pUDE150 to pUDE152 were transformed into E. coli and their sequences checked by Sanger sequencing (BaseClear BV, Leiden, The Netherlands).\n\nPFL- and PFL-AE-encoding sequences from Thalassiosira pseudonana (Genbank accession no. XM\\_002296598.1 and XM\\_002296597.1), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (AJ620191.1 and AY831434.1), E. coli (X08035.1), Lactobacillus plantarum (YP\\_003064242.1 and YP\\_003064243.1) and Neocallimastix frontalis (AY500825.1 and AY500826.1) were codon-optimized for expression in \\emph{S. cerevisiae} and signal sequences, predicted by TargetP, were removed (Emanuelsson et al., 2007). Expression cassettes in which these coding sequences were flanked by the TPI1 promoter and GND2 terminator (PFL) or FBA1 promoter and PMA1 terminator (PFL-AE), were synthesized by GeneArt GmbH. PFL and PFL-AE expression cassettes were PCR amplified with primer combinations 3384-3385 and 3386-3387, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Overlaps between the fragments were obtained using the primers, enabling homologous recombination. After linearization with SpeI and XhoI, the pRS426 backbone was assembled with the PFL and PFL-AE fragments via in vivo homologous recombination in \\emph{S. cerevisiae} CEN.PK113-5D (Kuijpers et al., 2013). Assembled plasmids were purified from uracil prototrophic transformants and transformed into E. coli. Sequences of the resulting plasmids pUDE201to pUDE215 (Table 2) were checked by sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2000, BaseClear BV, Leiden, The Netherlands), assembled as described previously (Kuijpers et al., 2013). All plasmid sequences were deposited at GenBank under accession numbers KF170375 (pUDE215), KF170376 (pUDE150), KF170377 (pUDE151), KF170378 (pUDE152), KF170379 (pUDE201), KF170380 (pUDE202), KF170381 (pUDE204) and KF170382 (pUDE214).\n\n\\subsection{Strain construction}\n\\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains were transformed according to Gietz et al.(2002). Knockout cassettes were obtained by PCR using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 with the templates pUG6, pUG27, pUG72, pUG73 (Gueldener et al., 2002), pUG-amdS (Solis-Escalante et al., 2013), pUG-hphNT1 (de Kok et al., 2011) and pUG-natNT2. Mutants were selected on solid medium (2\\% (w/v) agar) with 200 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1} G418, 200 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1} hygromycin B or 100 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1} nourseothricin (for dominant markers) or on drop-out (Sigma-Aldrich) or synthetic medium from which the appropriate auxotrophic requirements had been omitted. The Ald- strain IMK354 was obtained by the consecutive deletion of ALD2-ALD3, ALD4, ALD5 and ALD6 in strain CEN.PK102-12A. During strain construction, the Ald- strains were grown on acetate as a carbon source. IMK354 was transformed with the plasmids p426GPD (Mumberg et al., 1995), pUDE043, pUDE047, pUDE150, pUDE151 and pUDE152. In one of the resulting strains, IMZ290, \\emph{ACS2} and \\emph{ACS1} were subsequently deleted, yielding IMZ305. IMK427 was constructed by deletion of \\emph{ACS2} in strain CEN.PK102-12A. The acs2? strain was grown on ethanol as a carbon source. Transformation of strain IMK427 with plasmids pUDE201, pUDE202, pUDE204, pUDE214 and pUDE215 yielded strains IMZ369 - IMZ373, respectively (Table 1). In two strains, IMZ371 and IMZ372, \\emph{ACS1} was deleted. In all cases gene deletions and plasmid presence were confirmed by PCR using the diagnostic primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n\\subsection{Molecular biology techniques}\nPCR amplification with Phusion® Hot Start II High Fidelity Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed according to the manufacturer?s manual using HPLC- or PAGE-purified, custom-synthesized oligonucleotide primers (Sigma-Aldrich). Diagnostic PCR was done with DreamTaq (Thermo Scientific) and desalted primers (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA fragments obtained by PCR were loaded on gels containing 1\\% or 2\\% (w/v) agarose (Thermo Scientific) and 1xTAE buffer (Thermo Scientific), excised and purified (Zymoclean?, D2004, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Alternatively, fragments were purified using the GenElute? PCR Clean-Up Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Plasmids were isolated from E. coli with Sigma GenElute Plasmid kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the supplier?s manual. Yeast plasmids were isolated according to (Kuijpers et al., 2013) .Yeast genomic DNA was isolated using a YeaStar Genomic DNA kit (Zymo Research). E. coli DH5? (18258-012, Invitrogen) was transformed chemically (T3001, Zymo Research) or by electroporation. Chemical transformation was done according to supplier?s instructions. Electroporation was done in a 2 mm cuvette (165-2086, BioRad, Hercules, CA) using a Gene PulserXcell Electroporation System (BioRad), following the manufacturer?s protocol.\n\n\\subsection{Media and cultivation}\nShake flask cultures were grown at 30 °C in 500 mL flasks containing 100 mL synthetic medium (Verduyn et al., 1992) with 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose in an Innova incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) set at 200 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were grown in 100 mL shake flasks on the same medium, supplemented with the anaerobic growth factors ergosterol (10 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) and Tween 80 (420 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) according to (Verduyn et al., 1990b) and incubated on a Unimax1010 shaker (Heidolph, Kelheim, Germany) set at 200 rpm, placed in a Bactron anaerobic chamber (Sheldon MFG Inc., Cornelius, OR, USA) with a gas mixture of 5\\% H2, 6\\% CO2, and 89\\% N2. Optical density at 660 nm was measured in regular time intervals with a Libra S11 spectrophotometer (Biochrom, Cambrige, UK).  Controlled batch and chemostat cultivation was carried out at 30 °C in 2-L laboratory bioreactors (Applikon, Schiedam, The Netherlands) with working volumes of 1 L.  Chemostat cultivation was preceded by a batch phase under the same conditions. When a rapid decrease in CO2 production indicated glucose depletion in the batch cultures, continuous cultivation at a dilution rate of 0.10 h\\textsuperscript{-1} was initiated. Synthetic medium (Verduyn et al., 1992) supplemented with 7.5 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} or 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose was used in aerobic and anaerobic chemostat cultures, respectively. Culture pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition of 2 M KOH. In aerobic cultures, antifoam Pluronic PE 6100 (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) was used. The antifoam was autoclaved (110 °C) separately from the other medium ingredients and added as a 15\\% (w/v) stock solution to a final concentration of 0.15 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1}. Aerobic bioreactors were sparged with 500 mL?min\\textsuperscript{-1} air and stirred at 800 rpm to ensure fully aerobic conditions. Anaerobic bioreactors were stirred at 800 rpm and sparged with 500 mL?min\\textsuperscript{-1} nitrogen (< 10 ppm oxygen). Anaerobic growth media were supplemented with the anaerobic growth factors ergosterol (10 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) and Tween 80 (420 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}). Antifoam C Emulsion (Sigma-Aldrich) was autoclaved separately (120 °C) as a 20 \\% (w/v) solution and added to a final concentration of 0.2 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1}. In anaerobic bioreactor batch cultures, the medium contained 25 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose. To minimize diffusion of oxygen, the bioreactors were equipped with Nonprene tubing and Viton O-rings and medium reservoirs were continuously flushed with nitrogen. Specific growth rates were calculated from biomass dry weight determinations. \n\\subsection{Analytical methods}\nChemostat cultures were assumed to be in steady state when, after at least five volume changes, the carbon dioxide production rates changed by less than by 4\\% over 2 volume changes. Steady state samples were taken between 10 and 15 volume changes after inoculation. Dry weight measurements, HPLC analysis of the supernatant and off-gas analysis were performed as described previously (de Kok et al., 2011). Ethanol concentrations were corrected for evaporation as described by Guadalupe Medina et al. (2010). Samples for formate, glycerol and residual glucose determination were taken with the stainless steel bead method for rapid quenching of metabolites (Mashego et al., 2003).\n\n\\subsection{Enzymatic determination of metabolites}\nExtracellular formate, glycerol and residual glucose were measured using the Formic Acid Determination Kit (10979732035, R-Biopharm AG, Zaandijk, The Netherlands), Glycerol Enzymatic Determination Kit (10148270035, R-Biopharm AG) and EnzyPlus D-Glucose kit (EZS781, BioControl Systems Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA), respectively. Measurements were done according to manufacturers? instructions, except that the volume of the assays was proportionally downscaled. Absorbance was measured using cuvettes (final volume 1 mL, with at least two replicates) on a LibraS11 spectrophotometer or using 96-well plates (final volume 0.3 mL, with at least three replicates) on a Tecan GENios Pro (Tecan, Giessen, Netherlands).\n\n\\subsection{Intracellular metabolites determination}\nCulture samples for intracellular metabolite analysis were taken from bioreactors with a cold methanol rapid quenching method using a specially designed rapid sampling setup (Lange et al., 2001). 1.2 mL of broth was withdrawn into 5 mL of 80\\% aqueous methanol (v/v) solution pre-cooled to -40°C. Samples subsequently were washed with cold methanol and extracted with boiling ethanol as described in (Canelas et al., 2008a). The concentrations of glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, glyceraldehyde phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, erythrose-4-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, ribulose-5-phosphate, xylulose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, citrate, fumarate, malate, ?-ketoglutarate and trehalose were determined as methoxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives by GC-MS (Cipollina et al., 2009). The concentrations of succinate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, threhalose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, UDP-glucose and mannitol-1-phosphate were determined by anion-exchange LC-MS/MS (Van Dam et al., 2002). Concentrations of 20 amino acids and of pyruvate were determined by GC-MS (de Jonge et al., 2011). Concentrations of AMP, ADP, ATP, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, CoA, acetyl-CoA and FAD were determined by ultra high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry, UPLC-MS/MS. All measurements were carried out on an AcQuity? UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier XE mass spectrometer, (Micromass MS Technologies-Waters) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The MS was operated in negative ion mode. Metabolite detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The MRM transitions and corresponding instrument settings yielding the highest S/N, were separately found for each individual metabolite by direct infusion into the MS. The chromatographic separation of coenzymes in cell extracts was based on ion pair liquid chromatography on a reverse phase column AcQuity? UPLC\\textregistered BEH C18 (1.7$\\mu$m, 100 $×$ 2.1 mm i.d., waters, Ireland). A linear gradient of mobile phase A (2mM dibutylammonium acetate, DBAA, and 5\\% (v/v) acetonitrile) and mobile phase B (2 mM DBAA and 84\\% (v/v) acetonitrile) was used to separate the coenzymes. For both analytical platforms, uniformly 13C-labelled cell extracts were used as internal standards (Wu et al., 2005). \n\\subsection{Acetaldehyde determination}\nCulture samples for acetaldehyde analysis were obtained with the rapid sampling setup used for intracellular metabolites analysis (Lange et al., 2001). The acetaldehyde determination was performed as described previously (Bekers et al., 2013). Approximately 1.2 mL of broth was withdrawn into 6 mL of pre-cooled (-40 °C) quenching and derivatization solution containing 0.9 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} 2,4 ? dinitrophenylhydrazine and 1\\% (v/v) phosphoric acid in acetonitrile. After mixing and incubation for 2 hours on a Nutating Mixer (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium) at 4 °C, samples were stored at -40 °C. Before analysis 1 mL of defrosted and well mixed sample was centrifuged (15,000 g, 3 min). The supernatant was analysed via HPLC using a WATERS WAT086344 silica-based, reverse phase C18 column operated at room temperature with a gradient of acetonitrile as a mobile phase. A linear gradient was generated from eluent A ? 30 \\% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile solution and eluent B ? 80\\% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile solution. The mobile phase composition was changing from 0\\% to 100\\% of eluent B in 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 mL?min\\textsuperscript{-1}. A calibration curve was prepared with standard solution of 50.9 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} acetaldehyde-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in acetonitrile. \n\\subsection{Microarrays assay and analysis}\nSampling for transcriptome analysis from chemostat cultures and total RNA extraction was performed as described previously (Piper et al., 2002). Processing of total RNA was performed according to Affymetrix instructions. RNA target preparation for microarray expression analysis was done with the Gene 3? IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using 200 ng of total RNA. The manufacturer?s protocol was carried out with minor modifications, i.e the Affymetrix polyA RNA controls were excluded from the aRNA amplification protocol and the IVT reactions were incubated for 16 h at 40°C. Quality of total RNA, cDNA, aRNA and fragmented aRNA was checked with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). Hybridization, washing and scanning of Affymetrix chips were done according to manufacturers? instructions. For each strain analysed, microarrays were run on three independent cultures. Processing of expression data (normalization, expression cut-off, etc.) was performed as described previously (Boer et al., 2003). The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 3.0) (Tusher et al., 2001) add-in to Microsoft Excel was used for comparison of replicate array experiments using a minimal fold change of two and false discovery rate of 1\\%. Overrepresentation of functional categories in sets of differentially expressed genes was analysed according to (Knijnenburg et al., 2007). Transcript data are available at the Genome Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE47983.\n\nA set of acetaldehyde-responsive genes (Aranda and del Olmo, 2004) used as a reference is accessible from www.uv.es/~arandaa. Statistical significance of the over-representation of these genes in subsets of yeast genes was computed as described in (Knijnenburg et al., 2007), replacing functional categories by reference set of acetaldehyde-responsive genes.\n\n\\subsection{A-ALD activity assay}\nFor preparation of cell extracts, culture samples (corresponding to ca. 62.5 mg dry weight) were harvested from exponentially growing shake flasks cultures on 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose, washed, stored and prepared for sonication as described previously (Postma et al., 1989). Cell extracts were prepared by sonication (4 bursts of 30 s with 30 s intervals and at 0 °C) with an amplitude setting of 7 ? 8 ?m on a Soniprep 150 sonicator (Beun de Ronde BV, Abcoude, The Netherlands). After removal of cells and debris by centrifugation (4 °C, 20 min at 47000 g), the supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Protein concentrations in cell extracts were estimated with the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). A-ALD activity was measured at 30 °C on a Hitachi model 100?60 spectrophotometer by monitoring the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm in a 1 mL reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM Coenzyme A, 50 mM CHES buffer pH 9.5, 0.8 mM NAD+, 0.2 mM DTT and 20 ? 100 ?L of cell extract. The reaction was started by adding 100 ?L of freshly prepared 100 mM acetaldehyde solution. A-ALD activity in the reverse reaction was assayed as described previously (Guadalupe Medina et al., 2010). Enzyme activities are expressed as ?mol substrate converted per min per mg protein (U?mg protein\\textsuperscript{-1}). Reaction rates were proportional to the amounts of cell extract added.\n\n\\subsection{Viability staining}\nThe staining procedure was performed as described previously (Boender et al., 2011), using the FungaLightTM CFDA, AM / Propidium Iodide Yeast Vitality Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbrad, CA).  When membrane integrity is compromised, propidium iodide can diffuse into the cell and intercalate with DNA, yielding a red fluorescence. The acetoxymethyl ester of 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA, AM in DMSO) can permeate through intact membranes. In metabolically active cells, diacetate- and lipophilic blocking-groups are cleaved off by cytosolic non-specific esterases, yielding a charged, green fluorescent product. The pictures were taken with a fluorescent microscope (Imager-D1, Carl-Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with Filter Set 09 (FITC LP Ex. BP 450-490 Beamso. FT 510 Em. LP 515, Carl-Zeiss). \n\\subsection{Chitinase digestion}\n100 ?L of chemostat culture was spun down and resuspended in 100 ?L potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.10) or potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.10) with 1 mg?mL\\textsuperscript{-1} of chitinase (Chitinase from Trichoderma viride, >600 units?mg\\textsuperscript{-1}, Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. \n",

			"\\subsection{Strains and maintenance}\nThe \\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains used in this study (Table 1) share the CEN.PK genetic background (Entian and Kotter, 2007; Nijkamp et al., 2012). Stock cultures were grown aerobically in synthetic medium (Verduyn et al., 1992). When required, auxotrophic requirements were complemented with synthetic yeast drop-out medium supplements (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or by growth in YP medium (demineralized water, 10 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} Bacto yeast extract, 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} Bacto peptone). Carbon sources were either 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose, 2\\% (v/v) ethanol and/or 11.3 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} sodium acetate trihydrate. Stock cultures of \\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains IMZ383 and IMZ384 were grown anaerobically and supplemented with Tween-80 (420 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) and ergosterol (10 mg?L\\textsuperscript{-1}) added to the medium. Frozen stocks of \\emph{S. cerevisiae} and E. coli were prepared by the addition of glycerol (­30\\% v/v) to the growing shake-flask cultures and aseptically storing 1 mL aliquots at -80 °C.\n\n\\subsection{Plasmid construction}\nCoding sequences of Staphylococcus aureus adhE (NP\\_370672.1), Escherichia coli eutE (YP\\_001459232.1) and Listeria innocua lin1129 (NP\\_470466) were codon-optimized for \\emph{S. cerevisiae} with the JCat algorithm (Grote et al., 2005). Custom-synthesized coding sequences cloned in the pMA vector (Table 2) were provided by GeneArt GmbH (Regensburg, Germany). Gateway Cloning technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, A) was used to insert these coding sequences in the intermediate vector pDONR221 (BP reaction) and subsequently into pAG426-pGPD (Alberti et al., 2007) (LR reaction). The resulting plasmids pUDE150 to pUDE152 were transformed into E. coli and their sequences checked by Sanger sequencing (BaseClear BV, Leiden, The Netherlands).\n\nPFL- and PFL-AE-encoding sequences from Thalassiosira pseudonana (Genbank accession no. XM\\_002296598.1 and XM\\_002296597.1), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (AJ620191.1 and AY831434.1), E. coli (X08035.1), Lactobacillus plantarum (YP\\_003064242.1 and YP\\_003064243.1) and Neocallimastix frontalis (AY500825.1 and AY500826.1) were codon-optimized for expression in \\emph{S. cerevisiae} and signal sequences, predicted by TargetP, were removed (Emanuelsson et al., 2007). Expression cassettes in which these coding sequences were flanked by the TPI1 promoter and GND2 terminator (PFL) or FBA1 promoter and PMA1 terminator (PFL-AE), were synthesized by GeneArt GmbH. PFL and PFL-AE expression cassettes were PCR amplified with primer combinations 3384-3385 and 3386-3387, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Overlaps between the fragments were obtained using the primers, enabling homologous recombination. After linearization with SpeI and XhoI, the pRS426 backbone was assembled with the PFL and PFL-AE fragments via in vivo homologous recombination in \\emph{S. cerevisiae} CEN.PK113-5D (Kuijpers et al., 2013). Assembled plasmids were purified from uracil prototrophic transformants and transformed into E. coli. Sequences of the resulting plasmids pUDE201to pUDE215 (Table 2) were checked by sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2000, BaseClear BV, Leiden, The Netherlands), assembled as described previously (Kuijpers et al., 2013). All plasmid sequences were deposited at GenBank under accession numbers KF170375 (pUDE215), KF170376 (pUDE150), KF170377 (pUDE151), KF170378 (pUDE152), KF170379 (pUDE201), KF170380 (pUDE202), KF170381 (pUDE204) and KF170382 (pUDE214).\n\n\\subsection{Strain construction}\n\\emph{S. cerevisiae} strains were transformed according to Gietz et al.(2002).

Absorbance was measured using cuvettes (final volume 1 mL, with at least two replicates) on a LibraS11 spectrophotometer or using 96-well plates (final volume 0.3 mL, with at least three replicates) on a Tecan GENios Pro (Tecan, Giessen, Netherlands).\n\n\\subsection{Intracellular metabolites determination}\nCulture samples for intracellular metabolite analysis were taken from bioreactors with a cold methanol rapid quenching method using a specially designed rapid sampling setup (Lange et al., 2001). 1.2 mL of broth was withdrawn into 5 mL of 80\\% aqueous methanol (v/v) solution pre-cooled to -40°C. Samples subsequently were washed with cold methanol and extracted with boiling ethanol as described in (Canelas et al., 2008a). The concentrations of glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, glyceraldehyde phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, erythrose-4-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, ribulose-5-phosphate, xylulose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, citrate, fumarate, malate, ?-ketoglutarate and trehalose were determined as methoxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives by GC-MS (Cipollina et al., 2009). The concentrations of succinate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, threhalose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, UDP-glucose and mannitol-1-phosphate were determined by anion-exchange LC-MS/MS (Van Dam et al., 2002). Concentrations of 20 amino acids and of pyruvate were determined by GC-MS (de Jonge et al., 2011). Concentrations of AMP, ADP, ATP, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, CoA, acetyl-CoA and FAD were determined by ultra high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry, UPLC-MS/MS. All measurements were carried out on an AcQuity? UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier XE mass spectrometer, (Micromass MS Technologies-Waters) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The MS was operated in negative ion mode. Metabolite detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The MRM transitions and corresponding instrument settings yielding the highest S/N, were separately found for each individual metabolite by direct infusion into the MS. The chromatographic separation of coenzymes in cell extracts was based on ion pair liquid chromatography on a reverse phase column AcQuity? UPLC\\textregistered BEH C18 (1.7$\\mu$m, 100 $×$ 2.1 mm i.d., waters, Ireland). A linear gradient of mobile phase A (2mM dibutylammonium acetate, DBAA, and 5\\% (v/v) acetonitrile) and mobile phase B (2 mM DBAA and 84\\% (v/v) acetonitrile) was used to separate the coenzymes. For both analytical platforms, uniformly 13C-labelled cell extracts were used as internal standards (Wu et al., 2005). \n\\subsection{Acetaldehyde determination}\nCulture samples for acetaldehyde analysis were obtained with the rapid sampling setup used for intracellular metabolites analysis (Lange et al., 2001). The acetaldehyde determination was performed as described previously (Bekers et al., 2013). Approximately 1.2 mL of broth was withdrawn into 6 mL of pre-cooled (-40 °C) quenching and derivatization solution containing 0.9 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} 2,4 ? dinitrophenylhydrazine and 1\\% (v/v) phosphoric acid in acetonitrile. After mixing and incubation for 2 hours on a Nutating Mixer (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium) at 4 °C, samples were stored at -40 °C. Before analysis 1 mL of defrosted and well mixed sample was centrifuged (15,000 g, 3 min). The supernatant was analysed via HPLC using a WATERS WAT086344 silica-based, reverse phase C18 column operated at room temperature with a gradient of acetonitrile as a mobile phase. A linear gradient was generated from eluent A ? 30 \\% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile solution and eluent B ? 80\\% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile solution. The mobile phase composition was changing from 0\\% to 100\\% of eluent B in 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 mL?min\\textsuperscript{-1}. A calibration curve was prepared with standard solution of 50.9 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} acetaldehyde-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in acetonitrile. \n\\subsection{Microarrays assay and analysis}\nSampling for transcriptome analysis from chemostat cultures and total RNA extraction was performed as described previously (Piper et al., 2002). Processing of total RNA was performed according to Affymetrix instructions. RNA target preparation for microarray expression analysis was done with the Gene 3? IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using 200 ng of total RNA. The manufacturer?s protocol was carried out with minor modifications, i.e the Affymetrix polyA RNA controls were excluded from the aRNA amplification protocol and the IVT reactions were incubated for 16 h at 40°C. Quality of total RNA, cDNA, aRNA and fragmented aRNA was checked with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). Hybridization, washing and scanning of Affymetrix chips were done according to manufacturers? instructions. For each strain analysed, microarrays were run on three independent cultures. Processing of expression data (normalization, expression cut-off, etc.) was performed as described previously (Boer et al., 2003). The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 3.0) (Tusher et al., 2001) add-in to Microsoft Excel was used for comparison of replicate array experiments using a minimal fold change of two and false discovery rate of 1\\%. Overrepresentation of functional categories in sets of differentially expressed genes was analysed according to (Knijnenburg et al., 2007). Transcript data are available at the Genome Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE47983.\n\nA set of acetaldehyde-responsive genes (Aranda and del Olmo, 2004) used as a reference is accessible from www.uv.es/~arandaa. Statistical significance of the over-representation of these genes in subsets of yeast genes was computed as described in (Knijnenburg et al., 2007), replacing functional categories by reference set of acetaldehyde-responsive genes.\n\n\\subsection{A-ALD activity assay}\nFor preparation of cell extracts, culture samples (corresponding to ca. 62.5 mg dry weight) were harvested from exponentially growing shake flasks cultures on 20 g?L\\textsuperscript{-1} glucose, washed, stored and prepared for sonication as described previously (Postma et al., 1989). Cell extracts were prepared by sonication (4 bursts of 30 s with 30 s intervals and at 0 °C) with an amplitude setting of 7 ? 8 ?m on a Soniprep 150 sonicator (Beun de Ronde BV, Abcoude, The Netherlands). After removal of cells and debris by centrifugation (4 °C, 20 min at 47000 g), the supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Protein concentrations in cell extracts were estimated with the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). A-ALD activity was measured at 30 °C on a Hitachi model 100?60 spectrophotometer by monitoring the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm in a 1 mL reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM Coenzyme A, 50 mM CHES buffer pH 9.5, 0.8 mM NAD+, 0.2 mM DTT and 20 ? 100 ?L of cell extract. The reaction was started by adding 100 ?L of freshly prepared 100 mM acetaldehyde solution. A-ALD activity in the reverse reaction was assayed as described previously (Guadalupe Medina et al., 2010). Enzyme activities are expressed as ?mol substrate converted per min per mg protein (U?mg protein\\textsuperscript{-1}). Reaction rates were proportional to the amounts of cell extract added.\n\n\\subsection{Viability staining}\nThe staining procedure was performed as described previously (Boender et al., 2011), using the FungaLightTM CFDA, AM / Propidium Iodide Yeast Vitality Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbrad, CA).  When membrane integrity is compromised, propidium iodide can diffuse into the cell and intercalate with DNA, yielding a red fluorescence. The acetoxymethyl ester of 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA, AM in DMSO) can permeate through intact membranes. In metabolically active cells, diacetate- and lipophilic blocking-groups are cleaved off by cytosolic non-specific esterases, yielding a charged, green fluorescent product. The pictures were taken with a fluorescent microscope (Imager-D1, Carl-Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with Filter Set 09 (FITC LP Ex. BP 450-490 Beamso. FT 510 Em. LP 515, Carl-Zeiss). \n\\subsection{Chitinase digestion}\n100 ?L of chemostat culture was spun down and resuspended in 100 ?L potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.10) or potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.10) with 1 mg?mL\\textsuperscript{-1} of chitinase (Chitinase from Trichoderma viride, >600 units?mg\\textsuperscript{-1}, Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. \n",
